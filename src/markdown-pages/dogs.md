As I mentioned in the introduction, I'm a dog person! I've had 3 dogs in my whole life and even tho it saddens me that they are not alive anymore, I always try to remember all the good moments we had and their amazing life. I didn't think this blog would get too personal (it was supposed to be just a practice exercise), but I can't just not talk about my lovely dogs. 

## This is Fido!

My first dog was named Fido and he died at the age of 12 years. I brought him home against my family wishes and guess what happened a few months later, everybody loved him just as much as I did from the beginning! It was the first dog ever owned by my parents and Fido got really attached with everyone, specially with my mom, whom he really thought was also his üòÅ. My mom carried him all the time in her arms like he was just another baby! 

My second dog was Choco, and he was brought home because Fido was really sad (as were we all), my mother had passed away. At this time Fido was 3 years old. Initially he didn't want to play with Choco but eventualy they became best brothers! Choco was really energetic and he loved to sleep in my bed (Fido didn't like that too much). Unfortunately one day my father was taking the two dogs for a walk and Choco was hit by a car and died üò≠, we were all debastated, he was just 3 years old.  

My third dog was Mico and he was broght home because (once again), Fido was too sad because of the loss of Choco. Mico was really one of a kind, he never left Fido's side and he was all over us all the time, a really needy dog but we all loved him for that and more. He wouldn't eat if Fido didn't eat, he would not be quiet if Fido was not by his side, it's like he knew from day one that he was taken home to give company and support to Fido. One day both Fido and Mico got intoxicated because they were fumigating in our house, and sadly Mico did not make it through, he was 4 years old. 

I will be posting some pictures about them later!
