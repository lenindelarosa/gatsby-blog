These whales that are normally white are just marvelous! They are just so beautiful with a smiling face and really smart. Unlike other cetaceans they do not have a dorsal fin which helps them to easily swim in ice, which is their habitat (the artic ocean and north countries). 

I love seeing the belugas in their natural habitat, being free and happy! I do not support using any animal for entertainment and it pains me to see them in captivity, like aquariums or water parks! Hopefully it will come a day when this is completely banned worldwide or in the countries that do this the most, at least.

Here's a look at a funny video of a wild beluga playing:
