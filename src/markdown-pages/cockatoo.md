These birds are tremendously beautiful and their playfulness amazes me! They are very friendly and can learn to speak a few words if you constantly speak to them. I actually had a parrot when I was growing up, around 8 years old and it was my very first love. As an adult now, these kind of birds always get my attention. The variety of this family of birds is quite vast, but here I'll put some pictures of the ones I like the most.
